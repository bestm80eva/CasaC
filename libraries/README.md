This directory contains several libraries that I have used on the project. Some of them have been created by me and other I have copied.

### CardReader
This library implements an access control keypad. It supports PIN and RFID authentication. The device I used uses a Wiegand protocol. The implementation is interrupt driven to run in the background. 

Some more details about this library can be [found here](https://cat101.bitbucket.io/en/#!in%20wall/Keypad%20usage%20%26%20set%20up.md)
