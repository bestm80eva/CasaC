This directory contains several libraries that I have used on the project. Some of them have been created by me and other I have copied.

### CardReader
This library implements an access control keypad. It supports PIN and RFID authentication. The device I used uses a Wiegand protocol. The implementation is interrup driven to run in the background. 

Some more details about this library can be [found here](http://cat101.bitbucket.org/en/#!in wall/Keypad usage %26 set up.md)
